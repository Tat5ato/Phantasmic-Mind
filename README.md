Note that only Ryan and Tatsuya can assign an issue, however if anyone have an issue, you can discuss it with one of the two

# Pull Requests

This is how we will resolve the issues that would come up along the game's processes
The pull request will be done via the creation of a new file that will reference the original issue
This is done in the code page by creating a new code/file, going to the end of the page to find the selection that offers it to make a separate branch+a pull request
Select this to create a pull request and add a comment on the new branch to indicate that the pull request is to resolve an issue
Then when this is done, go to the comment section and there would be a selection to reference an issue; find the appropriate issue and select it and there, the pull request has been created
